Steps to Enable and Use Emmet in Visual Studio Code
1. Ensure Emmet is Enabled

    Emmet is enabled by default in VS Code, but if it's not working, you can verify the settings:
        Open the Command Palette (press Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
        Search for Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) and open it.
        Add the following line to ensure Emmet is enabled for your desired file types:

"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "html",
    "javascriptreact": "html",
    "typescriptreact": "html"
}
